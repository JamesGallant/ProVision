    <h2 id = "general">General</h2>
    <p>We provide two main figures, volcano plots and heatmaps. Both of these are based on the statistical tests performed in the previous section and are therefore reactive to this input. The only exception can be found in the heatmaps where total data is also plotted.The volcano plots are the end point of the initial data as well thus any changes made on the second tab, or data processing tab will propagate through and alter these plots accordingly. The current comparison in both cases will be displayed in the side bar and different comparisons can be accessed using the previous/next buttons.</p>
    <h2 id = "volcs">Volcano plots</h2>
    <p><img src="../media/main-volcs.png" style="width:380px;height:300px;margin-left:15px;float:right;">Volcano plots are a effective method of visualizing all the data found within a experimental setup and how each comparison differs to another. As an example, if there are two groups such as treatment control then you will only have one volcano plot. More than two conditions will create more volcano plots. The amount of volcano plots generated is the same as the amount of comparisons chosen during the statistical tests. We have chosen default aesthetics to create acceptable volcano plots, we do however encourage the user to play around with the features as the plot aesthetics can be improved significantly. These aesthetics can be accessed in the sub-menu's as well as additional less important features in the dropdown menu.</p><p style="font-size:1.2em">Altering point characteristics menu contains controls for changing the point size, transparency and colours of the up/downregulated proteins. As many points overlap, changing the transparency may be useful here. Significant proteins can be labeled and is dependent on the statistical tests. Thus if you have no significant proteins it will not be possible to label something. There are options to label either the upregulated, downregulated or both up-and downregulated proteins. Also the slider can be used to control how many proteins are labeled in descending order from most significant to least significant. Thus if the slider is at position 1 then this is the most significant protein. The plot title menu has options for providing a title, changing the position where 0.5 centers the title in the middle and also the face of the title. We can also change certain characteristics of this plot, such as the legend position and what additional features to display. Changing legend position is self explanatory. Features such as the lines representing the fold change can be toggled as well as displaying the number of significant proteins. More options for both these parameters are available in the dropdown menu such as changing the line width and line type (dashed line for instance) as well as positioning the significant counts.</p>
    <h2 id = "heatmap">Heatmaps</h2>
     <p><img src="../media/main-hm.png" style="width:300px;height:400px;margin-left:15px;float:right;">Heatmaps can either be used to visualize the expression of all data or zoom into the expression of significant data. It is especially powerful as it shows side by side comparison and clustering of both proteins and conditions. The heatmap is reactive and will change based on the options chosen. Thus feel free to render the heatmaps and change options on the go. The alter plot characteristics tab provides important options as to customizing the heatmap to user preferences. Unlike volcano plots, the heatmaps are subjective to user requirements. Options are available to either plot all data, i.e. <b> plot replicates</b> or <b>averages</b>. Plotting all the data allows for showcasing replicate data and that there is little deviation in specific proteins between groups however, if many groups are present or the expression of specific groups are important then the plot averages might be more useful. This simply calculates the average intensity of the replicates within each group. Displaying the row (protein) labels and column (sample) labels can be toggled, the row labels will be automatically unchecked if all data is displayed. Significant proteins can be isolated in the same fashion as the volcano plots where either the upregulated, downregulated or both conditions are displayed in the heatmap. This can be further altered by increasing or decreasing the number of proteins present in the heatmap. The default is 10 and thus plots the top 10 most significant proteins. The colour scheme can also be changed in the same way as correllograms, simply switch to a different palette and change the amount of colours present to represent the intensity if so desired. By default the border colour is black, this represents the borders between each of the cells. This can be changed to another colour as well. In the last menu tab exists options to alter the correlation metrics. Either toggle whether or not the rows and columns are clustered and the specific algorithm used for the clustering can be changed in this tab as well. Further aesthetics can be altered using the dropdown menu where features such as dendogram height and plot font size can be changed. This is usually useful when many proteins are displayed in the heatmap.   </p>

  <h2 id = "Webgestalt">Webgestalt ORA and GSEA enrichment</h2>
  <p><img src="../media/Webgestalt.png" style="width:380px;height:300px;margin-left:15px;float:right;">Webgestalt is a popular enrichment tool available <a href="http://www.webgestalt.org/", target="_blank">online</a> and has more flexibility than what we provide here. For detailed analysis please visit their website and a detailed explanation can be found in their <a href = "https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/W1/W199/5494758", target="_blank">manuscript</a>. We have included a part of webgestalt typically used for exploratory analysis in proteomics. Within ProVision, you can do both over representation analysis as well as gene set enrichment analysis. For both of these techniques there is a choice of gene ontology as well as pathway enrichments. The available gene ontologies are biological processes, cellular component and molecular function. The available pathways are Panther, KEGG, reactome and wikipathway. One caveat is that we can currently only use the build in model organisms. These organisms can be found in the side bar.The enrichments are dependend and linked with the statistical test, thus as with the rest of ProVision, prior changes will be propagated to the enrichments. The different comparisons are displayed in the comparison box and can be cycled through to extract data from that comparsion. Furthermore, because the enrichments are computationally intensive the pathway enrichment will initiate every time the calculate button is clicked.</p>
  <p>Over representation analysis (ORA) is a method that determines whether known biological processes are over-represented in a gene list and described in depth in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/bth456", target="_blank"> Boyle et al</a>. There are no values associated with over representation analysis and the enriched values represent either the up regulated or down regulated values as determined by the statistical test. These are reflected by the up regulated, down regulated options in the <b>what should be enriched</b> drop down menu. There is also an option available to enrich all the proteins after filtering. This can be of interest to identify a general profile of the proteins present in the sample without the use of differential expression between conditions. The Y-axis reflects the metrics that will be displayed and the enrichment ratio is the default. To visualise the underlying statistical tests the p-value and q-value can be plotted as well. It is possible to change the correction method from Benjamini-Hochberg to a stricter enrichment method if desired. There are also options to disregard statistical tests and rather perform the enrichments based on the top N associated pathways.</p>
  <p><img src="../media/gsea.png" style="width:60%; float:right;">Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) is related to ORA in that underlying biological processes or pathways can be enriched but takes into account a direct comparison by including the fold changes between two states. This is done automatically by ProVision by taking the previous statistical test into account. The options are strict, lenient and all protein ID's. The strict option refers to the protiens that were significant based on both q-value and fold change as chosen in the statistical tab. The lenient setting will isolate majority protein ID's from proteins that were significantly regulated with the q-value cut-off but will disregard the fold change. Finally the entire data base can be enriched as well. As with the ORA it is possible to plot different metrics on the y-axis such as the normalised enrichment score, p-value or q-value if the statistical parameters are of interest.</p>
  <p>The plots that are generated can be edited by using controls under the dropdown menu and is similiar to the other controls. Here the axis's can be named and the colours can be changed of the plot as well as the font sizes. It is also possible to control the pathways that are plotted based on their score by toggling the <b>top n slider</b>. Thus a value of 1 represents the most significant pathway or ontology. Finally, the underlying data and can be accessed by clicking the <b>show data</b> button. This will intiate a pop up where the data can be downloaded. To download all the meta data remeber to select all in the drop down menu. The available formats are CSV, excel and text. The plots can be downloaded with the <b> download enrichment plot</b> button. To control the file types of the plot access the download options tab.</p>
  <h2 id= "string">String protein-protein interaction network</h2>
 <p> <a href= "https://string-db.org/", target="_blank">String</a><img src="../media/String.png" style="width:50%;margin-left:15px;float:right;"> is a curated database with known and predicted protein-protein interactions and detailed description of their software can be found in their latest <a href= "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30476243", target="_blank">manuscript</a>. The string database has information on over 5000 organisms regarding the interaction networks. In ProVision you can querry the String database using either the up regulated or down regulated proteins that was determined by the statistical tests done previously. The data used to querry the string data base is reactive with the rest of the data in proVision, thus alterations that influence the statistical test will propagate to the string calls. It is possible that no information is displayed, this is due to no proteins being identified in the string network. In this case users can directly input uniprot identifiers in ProVision to querry the string database this way. It is important not to have any spaces between the uniprot identifiers and each identifier must be separated by a comma for the querry to work. Users can also opt to change the significant threshhodls and the maximum nodes to fetch from the querry. The significance threshold ranges from 0 to 1000 where larger numbers represent stricter results. </p>
 <p><img src="../media/string_nodes.png" style="width:50%;margin-left:15px;float:right;">The results from string are displayed on ProVision and followes the same conventions as the website. For brevity the explanation of the nodes and their corresponding notations as well as the links are displayed on the on the right. Nodes are coloured by querry and first interactors while blank nodes are secondary interactors. When proteins are present within the nodes, this indicates a predicted or known 3D structure. String automatically cross references multiple databases and manuscripts to provide information and each link is indicative of this information.</p>
