    <h2 id = "QQ"> Q-Q plots and histograms </h2>
      <p style="font-size:1.2em"><img src="../media/QC-qqHisto.png" style="width:450px;height:400px;margin-left:15px;float:right;">Quantile of quantile (Q-Q) plots and histograms can be used to visualize a normal distribution. Ideally data should be normally distributed to for imputation as well as statistical testing.</p>
      <p style="font-size:1.2em">Q-Q plots take the given data, in this case intensity data after processing and compares it to a known distribution using a scatter plot. The theoretical quantile represents a known normal distribution (calculated by us) compared and is compared to the intensity distributions of each sample. If a perfect straight line is formed then your data is 100% normally distributed, however this is very rare. Typically tailing can be seen, either one or two tails and this is normal for proteomcis data. For more about Q-Q plots, check out the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q%E2%80%93Q_plot" target="_blank"> wiki </a>page.Histograms function in a similar manner and plots the distribution curve. This is usually more aesthetically pleasing than Q-Q plots, however tailing is not as easily spotted. If distributions are all you need then this should suffice.</p>
      <p style="font-size:1.2em">As both the Q-Q plots and histograms are linked they share some similar aesthetic values. Changing the border and fill colour of the plot elements will affect both. Further options to alter the aesthetics of a specific plot type can be found under the appropriate headings, i.e. qqPlot/Histogram aesthetics. The plot title can be added and will also be used as an individual file name. Take care if plots are saved as bulk because the title will not be used and will be on every plot. Point size and transparency simply controls how large and how transparent each element will. Under histogram aesthetics the same applies for the title. Bin width represents the number of bins or bars are present to show the distribution, reducing this slider will reduce the "resolution" of the distribution. A density plot of the distribution can be added to the histograms as well and both the colour and density can be controlled. More options to control aesthetics are available in the toolbar above the plot. </p>
   <h2 id = "scatterplots"> Scatter plots </h2>
      <p style="font-size:1.2em"><img src="../media/QC-scatterMain.png" style="width:400px;height:200px;margin-left:15px;float:right;">Scatter plots are used to visualize comparisons of one sample to another. There should be a correlation between replicates and scatter plots are used to visualize this correlation. We have restricted the comparisons to be limited within groups, if you would like to look at correlation between groups jump to <a href="#corr">correlelograms</a>.Thus multiple plots will be generated drawing comparisons within groups and can be accessed by cycling through the plots using the previous/next buttons.If a relatively straight line is formed, bearing in mind that a perfect straight line is impossible, then samples are highly correlated. Low correlation can be indicative of an outlier sample that should rather be left out from further calculation as it will highly skew the standard deviation.</p>
      <p style="font-size:1.2em">Various controls for the changing the aesthetics of the plots are available yet less complex than the Q-Q plots or histograms. Point colour changes the fill appearance of each point and the default border colour is black. As overlaps occur, a option for changing the transparency is available as well as increasing the size of each individual point. The specific shape of the point can also be changed if circles are not desired. More options are available under the dropdown controls above the plot, where the border colour can be changed among others. The font size values are the same as seen in common programs such as MS word and title position = 0.5 indicates a halfway mark.</p>
    <h2 id = "corr"> Correlelograms </h2>
      <p style="font-size:1.2em"><img src="../media/QC-corr.png" style="width:350px;height:300px;margin-left:15px;float:right;">Correlelograms are used to visualize <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient_of_determination" target="_blank">coefficient of determination</a> or R-squared values obtained from comparing each sample to every other sample in the same fashion as scatter plots. Thus correlelograms condense scatter plots and allows differences in correlation to be viewed as a form of heatmap. What can usually be seen is high correlation within replicate groups and low correlation between test groups, if everything went according to plan!</p><p style="font-size:1.2em">We can choose to display the correlation value on the plot itself. Choosing not to display this value will not affect how the correlations are calculated. We can also change the colour of the heatmap. Various options are available and uses predefined colour schemes from R. Setting the lower correlation limit can compress the plottable data and give greater contrast to the plot. It is rare that two samples will vary greatly in their correlation, especially after transformation thus changing the lower limit becomes necessary. The tutorial data requires the limit to be set to 0.8 to see a good contrast. Under the dropdown menu two important options can be found, these include the correlation decimal points and the colour scale. The correlation decimal points will influence the calculation, more decimal points adds more resolution to the plot. The colour scale simply changes the number of colours used to plot the range between the lower and upper limits where the default is 11.</p>
    <h2 id = "pca"> Principle component analysis </h2>
      <p style="font-size:1.2em"><img src="../media/QC-pca.png" style="width:350px;height:300px;margin-left:15px;float:right;">Principle component analysis is quite literally an analysis of the principle components and one of our favorite tests. These components represent the variation within a given dataset and is similar to correlation but uses stronger metrics by calculating variation directly. The first component represents the majority of variation and the second represents the second most variation and so on. For the our purposes the first two components are of importance. If we consider a differential expression experiment, the greatest amount of variation or the first principle component should occur between groups. There is always experimental variation, which often represents the second most variation in an experiment and thus would cause separation on the second component. In an ideal experimental setup treatment and control should separate in the first component while replicates of each should separate in the second. Ideally separation between replicates should be minimal and this indicates a good reproducibility of an experiment.</p><p style="font-size:1.2em">The PCA analysis provides the option to Z-score the data as the default. This transformation centers the data around zero with a minimal value of -3 standard deviations from the mean and a maximum of +3 standard deviations from the mean. The transformation is done by subtracting each the mean of the total distribution from each observation (protein) and dividing that value by the standard deviation of the distribution. Changing the point size changes the size of the characters, circles by default and can also be changed to other characters. The colour input is generated dynamically based on the input from the assign groups page and can be accessed in a sub menu. See the dropdown button for more options. </p>
