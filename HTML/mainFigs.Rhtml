    <p style="font-size:1.2em">We provide two main figures, volcano plots and heatmaps. Both of these are based on the statistical tests performed in the previous section and are therefore reactive to this input. The only exception can be found in the heatmaps where total data is also plotted.The volcano plots are the end point of the initial data as well thus any changes made on the second tab, or data processing tab will propagate through and alter these plots accordingly. The current comparison in both cases will be displayed in the side bar and different comparisons can be accessed using the previous/next buttons.</p>
    <h2 id = "volcs">Volcano plots</h2>
    <p style="font-size:1.2em"><img src="../media/main-volcs.png" style="width:380px;height:300px;margin-left:15px;float:right;">Volcano plots are a effective method of visualizing all the data found within a experimental setup and how each comparison differs to another. As an example, if there is two groups such as treatment control then you will only have one volcano plot. More than two conditions will create more volcano plots. The amount of volcano plots generated is the same as the amount of comparisons chosen during the statistical tests. We have chosen default aesthetics to create acceptable volcano plots, we do however encourage the user to play around with the features as the plot aesthetics can be improved significantly. These aesthetics can be accessed in the sub-menu's as well as additional less important features in the dropdown menu.</p><p style="font-size:1.2em">Altering point characteristics menu contains controls for changing the point size, transparency and colours of the up/downregulated proteins. As many points overlap, changing the transparency may be useful here. Significant proteins can be labeled and is dependent on the statistical tests. Thus if you have no significant proteins it will not be possible to label something. There are options to label either the upregulated, downregulated or both up-and downregulated proteins. Also the slider can be used to control how many proteins are labeled in descending order from most significant to least significant. Thus if the slider is at position 1 then this is the most significant protein. The plot title menu has options for providing a title, changing the position where 0.5 centers the title in the middle and also the face of the title. We can also change certain characteristics of this plot, such as the legend position and what additional features to display. Changing legend position is self explanatory. Features such as the lines representing the fold change can be toggled as well as displaying the number of significant proteins. More options for both these parameters are available in the dropdown menu such as changing the line width and line type (dashed line for instance) as well as positioning the significant counts.</p>
    <h2 id = "heatmap">Heatmaps</h2>
     <p style="font-size:1.2em"><img src="../media/main-hm.png" style="width:300px;height:400px;margin-left:15px;float:right;">Heatmaps can either be used to visualize the expression of all data or zoom into the expression of significant data. It is especially powerful as it shows side by side comparison and clustering of both proteins and conditions. The heatmap is reactive and will change based on the options chosen. Thus feel free to render the heatmaps and change options on the go. The alter plot characteristics tab provides important options as to customizing the heatmap to user preferences. Unlike volcano plots, the heatmaps are subjective to user requirements. Options are available to either plot all data, i.e. <b> plot replicates</b> or <b>averages</b>. Plotting all the data allows for showcasing replicate data and that there is little deviation in specific proteins between groups however, if many groups are present or the expression of specific groups are important then the plot averages might be more useful. This simply calculates the average intensity of the replicates within each group. Displaying the row (protein) labels and column (sample) labels can be toggled, the row labels will be automatically unchecked if all data is displayed. Significant proteins can be isolated in the same fashion as the volcano plots where either the upregulated, downregulated or both conditions are displayed in the heatmap. This can be further altered by increasing or decreasing the number of proteins present in the heatmap. The default is 10 and thus plots the top 10 most significant proteins. The colour scheme can also be changed in the same way as correllograms, simply switch to a different palette and change the amount of colours present to represent the intensity if so desired. By default the border colour is black, this represents the borders between each of the cells. This can be changed to another colour as well. In the last menu tab exists options to alter the correlation metrics. Either toggle whether or not the rows and columns are clustered and the specific algorithm used for the clustering can be changed in this tab as well. Further aesthetics can be altered using the dropdown menu where features such as dendogram height and plot font size can be changed. This is usually useful when many proteins are displayed in the heatmap.   </p>
